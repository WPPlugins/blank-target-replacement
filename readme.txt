A target=_blank replacement using a small piece of javascript and rel=external.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to mark any (or all) of your Blogroll links as 'external' and implements a small bit of javascript to open links in new windows. Also marks all links in posts as 'external' (kudos to Mdkart's Add Lightbox for the idea and code!).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the blank-target-replace folder to WordPress plugins directory and activate on the Plugins page in WP-Admin
2. Go to Manage > External Links
3. Choose the links you want to open in a new window, or tick the top checkbox in the grey bar to check all links as external.  Click the "Mark Links External" button at the very bottom of the page.
4. That's it! Links in your blog entries will automatically have rel="external" added.
